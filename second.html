		<h3> History and characteristics<br></h3>
		
<p>		In 1966, Charlottetown Rural High School was built in the growing suburban community of West Royalty,<br> 
		north of the municipal limits of the city of Charlottetown.In 1994, The school was completely renovated to its present configuration<br>
		which saw a new cafeteria and specialist instruction space added. The renovations saw the building's exterior and interior remodelled using <br>
		a modern design of unusual angles and curves that symbolize waves which surround Prince Edward Island.The school is currently the largest in the <br>
		province in terms of student enrollment and 2nd largest in terms of area. The high school offers both French and English language and <br>
		the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. </p>

		<h3 id="me">My experience in CRHS</h3>
		
		<p>Not going to lie if you want to come here to study you will feel disappointed.<br>
			The rural is a nice place to meet some new people or take some non-academic ctivities, but for academic no.<br> 
			You shall know CRHS is a relative smaller public school compare to others in larger provinces, so both the budget and resources are<br>
			not very satisfying. The education curriculum was not setted to be challenging and you can feel you are not being pushed to pursue an academic achievement.<br>
			However, the school has a good sport spirit and there are multipule sport teams and interesting in-school clubs that help stdent to explore. <br>
			And I would say, Most Teachers in the school are nice and glad to help students.</p>
